- Searching by object name

- Sorting objects by name

- Sorting objects by date

- Sorting objects by file size

## Installing/running the app

Be sure to edit the config.json with your Cloudflare API details, domain and bucket name:

```json
{
    "account_id": "",
    "access_key_id": "",
    "secret_access_key": "",
    "domain": "custom.domain.here or r2.dev domain",
    "bucket_name": "your bucket name here",
    "directory": "your directory (optional)"
}
```

**Make sure domain doesn't contain any slashes.**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
